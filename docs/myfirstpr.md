# My First PR

To get started, you'll need to set up your local machine for development. Follow the instructions at [docs/setup.md](/docs/setup.md).

## What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the main branch. You can think of it as a way to submit your work for review. You can read more about pull requests [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Creating

Assuming you followed the steps in [docs/setup.md](/docs/setup.md), you should have a fork and have local copy of the repository on your machine. You can make changes to the code on your local machine and push them to your forked repository on GitHub.

Once your changes are ready to be reviewed, you can create a pull request. Here is how to create a pull request: https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
