## About

Bright Endeavors is a @uctechteam project.

Bright Endeavors has an ambassador program, where ambassadors can gain rewards for participating in various activities including referring the organization to friends and family, purchasing products, and sharing on social media. They need TechTeam to build a web page to keep track of customer referrals and incorporate a way to reward participants in their ambassador program.

To set up your local machine for development, follow the instructions at [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).
